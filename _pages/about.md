Welcome to my page! I am a third-year Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Michigan. I have always been fascinated by how things move. For the past few years or so, I have been fascinated by motion of small things like cells, electrons, and synthetic particles. Before that, I tried to model larger things (like dolphin tails!). Large or small, the things I study usually move in fluids, and understanding these fluids is crucial to the research I do.    

I was previously an undergraduate at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) in sunny Southern California, where I studied mathematics and physics (and a little Spanish). I was fortunate to be a part of summer research programs (REUs) at [IUPUI](https://science.iupui.edu/about/science-stories/stories/2021-07-06-mathematical-sciences-hosts-summer-research-experience-for-undergraduates.html) in 2021 and at the [University of Maryland](https://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc/REU2022.html) in 2022. 

While math and physics are my first loves, tennis comes a close second. I started playing tennis when I watched Roger Federer at the US Open in 2009, and I haven't stopped since. Apart from tennis, I like to watch Spanish or math movies (and if I'm feeling really brave, movies about math in Spanish). In the last year, I've gotten into Korean dramas, and I was recently very excited to learn that there were K-dramas about math!
